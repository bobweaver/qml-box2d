    \briefIf you want to create a sophisticated mechanical contraption you might want to use gears. In principle
you can create gears in Box2D by using compound shapes to model gear teeth. This is not very efficient
and might be tedious to author. You also have to be careful to line up the gears so the teeth mesh
smoothly. Box2D has a simpler method of creating gears: the gear joint.
\image gearJoint.png
The gear joint can only connect revolute and/or prismatic joints.
Like the pulley ratio, you can specify a gear ratio. However, in this case the gear ratio can be negative.
Also keep in mind that when one joint is a revolute joint (angular) and the other joint is prismatic
(translation), and then the gear ratio will have units of length or one over length.
coordinate1 + ratio * coordinate2 == constant
Here is an example gear joint. The bodies myBodyA and myBodyB are any bodies from the two joints, as
long as they are not the same bodies.
b2GearJointDef jointDef;
jointDef.bodyA = myBodyA;
jointDef.bodyB = myBodyB;
jointDef.joint1 = myRevoluteJoint;
jointDef.joint2 = myPrismaticJoint;
jointDef.ratio = 2.0f * b2_pi / myLength;
Note that the gear joint depends on two other joints. This creates a fragile situation. What happens if
those joints are deleted?
Caution
Always delete gear joints before the revolute/prismatic joints on the gears.
Otherwise your code will crash in a bad way due to the orphaned joint pointers in
the gear joint. You should also delete the gear joint before you delete any of the
bodies involved.
