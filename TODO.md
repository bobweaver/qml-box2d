Shape Ray Cast 

Implicit Destruction 

b2DynamicTree

Overlap

Islang 

look at some of the signals for qml that start with uppercase and change 
them to be camel-cased 

Translation of examples and also inline. Also write translation scripts. (qsTr NOOP ect)

add better things for qml2puppet


## Examples 

look at some of the statements (javascript) and change them from == to === or != to !=== ect 

Add Joseph Mills example of "supertux" as a tutorial 

1) making the world 
2) making the flickage world 
3) making a Hero 
4) making a enemy 
5) making a way to keep track of score 
6) make hero shoot fire 
7) populate the world with Bodys 
8) making a boss
9) use extrenal tools to make levels (PS->qml Gimp->qml Tiled ?)
10) make a new level 

I might make this into a read tutorial or a video one. Need the community's input on that. 

## DOCS 
FIND A SPEELING CHECKER !

fix all the DOCME tags to be docs 
check for spelling errors. 
translations 

take the pdf documentation that is out there and make a qdoc book out of it. (upstream pending)

make the EXAMPLE docs better explaning how they are out togeather. via adding qdoc tags in the code. or to the qdoc example files themselfs

Remove boilerplete license from the qdoc files and add GPLv3+ to them. and add Joseph name to them 

 
## Pacakging 

fix up the QBS stuff so that it works !

(optinal)
make a debian and a rpm script that can make packages.  


## Community 
talk to the community about a sperate IRC channel that can be used just for the qml/qt bindings side of things 

think about summer of code and other things that can help with development in the future
